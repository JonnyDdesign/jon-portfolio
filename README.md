# Jon's Portfolio

## About the Project
I decided my portfolio needs a refresh and therefore this project will represent an updated version of my portfolio.  

I have an idea in mind of making an interactive website for larger screens and an alternate UI for smaller screens and mobile. 

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Setup/Installation
For now, you can clone this repo and `cd` into the cloned repo from your terminal before opening the index.html file to view the site locally.
Eventually, I will have my site live and up and running with a link here for you to view.

## Status
As previously stated, this site is a work in progress. Check back periodically to view the new and improved portfolio.
